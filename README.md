üóÇÔ∏è **Project structure**
```
.
‚îú‚îÄ app.py            # Gradio web interface for browser-based interaction
‚îú‚îÄ main.py           # Console runner with Rich-styled human approval flow
‚îú‚îÄ .env.example      # Environment template for Nebius API key
‚îú‚îÄ requirements.txt  # Python dependencies and package versions
‚îî‚îÄ README.md         # Comprehensive documentation
```

üöÄ **Quickstart**

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- **NEBIUS_API_KEY** (Nebius AI platform access)

**1) Clone & install**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdullahRasheed45/ai-projects-human-in-the-loop-agent.git
cd ai-projects-human-in-the-loop-agent

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: NEBIUS_API_KEY=your_nebius_api_key_here
```

**2) Run console interface**
```bash
python main.py
```

**Interactive Flow**: The agent will propose actions and wait for your approval before executing any tools:
- **`y`** ‚Üí Continue (execute the tool)
- **`n`** ‚Üí Cancel (abort the action)  
- **`retry`** ‚Üí Try again with refined approach (up to 3 times)

**3) Run web interface**
```bash
python app.py
```

**Browser Experience**: Opens Gradio interface for point-and-click interaction with the same approval controls built into the web UI.

üß† **How it works (HITL architecture)**

**1. Intent Recognition**: You request content (fact, quote, or joke) through console or web interface

**2. Tool Planning**: Agent analyzes request and selects appropriate content generation tool

**3. **Human Approval Gate**: System pauses and presents the planned action for your explicit approval

**4. **Execution Control**: Based on your response:
   - **Continue** ‚Üí Tool executes and returns result
   - **Retry** ‚Üí Agent refines approach and asks again (bounded retries)
   - **Cancel** ‚Üí Action is aborted, agent adapts or exits gracefully

**5. **Result Delivery**: Approved content is displayed through Rich console formatting or Gradio web interface

‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration options**

**Model Selection**:
```python
# Default: Nebius Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct
# Switch to other Nebius models for different performance characteristics
MODELS = {
    'fast': 'llama-3-8b-instruct',      # Quicker responses
    'balanced': 'llama-3-70b-instruct', # Standard quality
    'premium': 'llama-3.3-70b-instruct' # Best performance
}
```

**Retry Behavior**:
```python
# Customize retry limits and behavior
MAX_RETRIES = 3                    # Maximum retry attempts
RETRY_DELAY = 1.0                  # Delay between retries (seconds)
PROGRESSIVE_PROMPTING = True       # Refine prompts on each retry
```

**Tool Customization**:
```python
# Extend or modify available tools
tools = {
    'fact_tool': generate_interesting_fact,
    'quote_tool': generate_motivational_quote, 
    'joke_tool': generate_entertaining_joke,
    'custom_tool': your_custom_function      # Add new capabilities
}
```

**Interface Preferences**:
- **Console Mode**: Rich-formatted output with colored text and interactive prompts
- **Web Mode**: Clean Gradio interface with buttons and text areas
- **API Mode**: Programmatic access for integration into larger systems

üß™ **Example interactions**

**Console Interface Flow**:
```bash
> What would you like? (fact | quote | joke)
> joke

ü§ñ The agent wants to call: joke_tool
üí≠ Purpose: Generate an entertaining joke for you

Approve this action? [y/n/retry]: y

‚úÖ Joke Generated:
"Why did the developer go broke? Because he used up all his cache!"
```

**Retry Scenario**:
```bash
> What would you like? (fact | quote | joke)  
> quote

ü§ñ The agent wants to call: quote_tool  
üí≠ Purpose: Generate a motivational quote

Approve this action? [y/n/retry]: retry

üîÑ Retrying (1/3)... Refining approach...
ü§ñ The agent wants to call: quote_tool
üí≠ Purpose: Generate an inspiring, personalized motivational quote

Approve this action? [y/n/retry]: y

üõ°Ô∏è **Why human-in-the-loop matters**

**Trust & Control**: Maintains human agency over AI actions, preventing unexpected or unwanted tool executions

**Learning & Oversight**: Allows users to understand AI decision-making processes before committing to actions

**Risk Mitigation**: Essential pattern for high-stakes applications (emails, purchases, code deployments) where mistakes have consequences

**Iterative Refinement**: Retry mechanism enables collaborative improvement of AI responses through human feedback

**Scalable Pattern**: Same architecture applies to complex enterprise AI systems requiring human approval workflows

**Educational Value**: Perfect introduction to responsible AI development and human-AI collaboration principles

üîß **Advanced customization**

**Custom Tool Development**:
```python
# Add domain-specific tools
def weather_tool(location: str) -> str:
    """Get weather information with human approval"""
    return f"Weather for {location}: Sunny, 22¬∞C"

def email_tool(recipient: str, message: str) -> str:
    """Send email with human approval (critical for automation)"""
    return f"Email sent to {recipient}: {message}"
```

**Approval Workflow Customization**:
```python
# Customize approval prompts and options
APPROVAL_PROMPTS = {
    'standard': "Approve this action? [y/n/retry]",
    'detailed': "Review and approve:\n{tool_details}\nProceed? [continue/cancel/modify]",
    'risk_aware': "‚ö†Ô∏è This action will {consequences}. Confirm? [yes/no/revise]"
}
```

**Integration Patterns**:
```python
# Embed HITL pattern in larger applications
class HITLWorkflow:
    def __init__(self, approval_handler):
        self.approval_handler = approval_handler
    
    async def execute_with_approval(self, action):
        if await self.approval_handler.request_approval(action):
            return await action.execute()
        return None
```

üîí **Security & safety considerations**

**API Key Protection**: Store Nebius API keys securely in environment variables, never in code

**Input Validation**: Sanitize user inputs to prevent prompt injection or malicious requests

**Audit Trail**: Log all approval decisions and tool executions for compliance and debugging

**Rate Limiting**: Implement safeguards against excessive API usage or retry loops

**Scope Limitation**: Keep tool capabilities appropriate for the approval level (low-risk for demo, high-oversight for production)

üêõ **Troubleshooting**

**Authentication Issues**:
- **"API Key Missing"** ‚Üí Verify `NEBIUS_API_KEY` is set in `.env` file and loaded correctly
- **"Invalid API Response"** ‚Üí Check API key validity and account status at Nebius platform
- **"Rate Limit Error"** ‚Üí Implement delays between requests or upgrade API plan

**Interaction Problems**:
- **"No Response to Approval"** ‚Üí Ensure console input is exactly `y`, `n`, or `retry` (case-sensitive)
- **"Tool Not Found"** ‚Üí Verify tool name matches available options (fact, quote, joke)
- **"Retry Loop"** ‚Üí Check retry counter and prompt refinement logic

**Interface Issues**:
- **Console Not Displaying** ‚Üí Install Rich properly: `pip install rich`
- **Gradio Won't Launch** ‚Üí Run `python app.py` from project root, check port availability
- **Web UI Not Responding** ‚Üí Clear browser cache, check firewall settings

**Performance & Quality**:
- **Slow Responses** ‚Üí Switch to faster Nebius model or reduce content complexity
- **Poor Content Quality** ‚Üí Adjust prompts or upgrade to premium model
- **Too Many Retries** ‚Üí Reduce max retry limit or improve prompt specificity

‚òÅÔ∏è **Deployment strategies**

**Local Development**:
```bash
# Development mode with debug logging
export DEBUG=true
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
python main.py
```

**Web Deployment**:
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Upload code and set `NEBIUS_API_KEY` in Space secrets
- **Streamlit Cloud**: Deploy Gradio app with environment variable configuration
- **Railway/Render**: Production deployment with proper secret management

**Enterprise Integration**:
```python
# API service wrapper for enterprise systems
from fastapi import FastAPI
from hitl_agent import HITLAgent

app = FastAPI()
agent = HITLAgent()

@app.post("/approve-and-execute")
async def api_with_approval(request: ToolRequest):
    return await agent.execute_with_human_approval(request)
```

**Docker Deployment**:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
ENV NEBIUS_API_KEY=""
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
